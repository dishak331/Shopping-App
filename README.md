# shopping_app

This is more of a backend based project which is concentrated on the state management using the provider package and the firebase authentication. I have added some animations here and there.

Users can sign up, sign in and sign out with no issue. They can watch products, add products, can put products in the cart and after clicking on the 'order now' button they can see their purchase history in the orders section. Users can also put a product in their wishlist.
